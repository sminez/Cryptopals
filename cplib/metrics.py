.:Metrics and statistical summaries:.
-------------------------------------
A collection of useful things to calculate when trying to compare
plaintext and ciphertext.

NOTE: In some cases the output of these functions differs from the
      normal mathematical definition so that a lower value is taken
      to be better. This is to ensure that further processing and
      ranking based on these metrics is consistent.
